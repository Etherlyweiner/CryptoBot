## Implementation Details

### Position Sizing Formula
```python
position_size = (account_balance * risk_per_trade) / (entry_price - stop_loss)
```

### Risk Metrics
1. **Position Risk**:
   - Individual position risk <= 1% of capital
   - Position size <= 5% of capital

2. **Portfolio Risk**:

   - Maximum drawdown <= 10% of peak capital

3. **Market Risk**:
   - Volatility within 1-5% range
   - Minimum liquidity $1M daily volume
   - Maximum correlation 0.5 between positions

## Recovery Procedures

1. **Drawdown Recovery**:
   - Trading halted at 10% drawdown
   - Position sizes reduced proportionally to drawdown
   - Higher win rate required for new positions

2. **Performance Recovery**:
   - Trading paused if win rate < 50%
   - Review and adjustment of strategy parameters
   - Gradual position size increase as performance improves

   - Win rate
   - Drawdown percentage
   - Total exposure

2. **Position Metrics**:
   - Individual position sizes
   - Risk-reward ratios
   - Correlation matrix
   - Volatility levels

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Sharpe ratio
   - Maximum drawdown
   - Recovery factor
   - Profit factor
